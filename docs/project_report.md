- **Product Search**: Efficient querying of the SQLite database based on user input and filters
- **Purchase Simulation**: Endpoints to handle the purchase process and update product stock
- **Chat History**: Storage and retrieval of user chat sessions

Database Schema:
- Users: id, username, password_hash
- Products: id, name, category, price, description, stock
- Purchases: id, user_id, product_id, purchase_date
- ChatHistory: id, user_id, message, sender, timestamp

### 3.3 Chatbot Logic and Natural Language Processing

The chatbot utilizes a rule-based system for interpreting user queries, with the potential for future integration of more advanced NLP techniques. Key aspects include:

- Keyword extraction for product searches
- Intent recognition for distinguishing between search, filter, and purchase requests
- Context maintenance throughout the conversation
